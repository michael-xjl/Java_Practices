 *
 * Purpose: consider when to use Getters and Setter properly (Justified)
 *
 * when we are used to JavaBean style, devs like to generate the get/set methods for all fields of an Object without
 * giving it any thought.
 * especially,  there has IDE to generate such methods by one click.
 * actually, at most times, this will violate encapsulation.
 *
 * A lot of fields are not supposed to expose to outside to modify their status
