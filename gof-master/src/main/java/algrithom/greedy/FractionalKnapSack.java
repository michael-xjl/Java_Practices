/**
 * In no Fractional Knapsack
 *
 * Input:
 *   Items as (value, weight) pairs
 *   arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}}
 *   Knapsack Capacity, W = 50;
 * Output:
 *   Maximum possible value = 220
 *   by taking items of weight 20 and 30 kg
 *
 *   In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.
 *
 * Input :
 *    Same as above
 * Output :
 *    Maximum possible value = 240
 *    By taking full items of 10 kg, 20 kg and
 *    2/3rd of last item of 30 kg
